Student data and operations

   In the beginning, we let the user insert data for 10 students (the number of students can be modified) with defensive programming.
The data is their first name, their last name, their mid-term grade and their final grade.
   Secondly, the program outputs all the data in vertical matrices next to each other.
   In addition, it will output a matrix that includes the average of each student, but with 40% for their mid-term grade and 60% for their final grade.
   Finally, the program will output the first name,the last name and the average of the best students and the students that need to be improved.
